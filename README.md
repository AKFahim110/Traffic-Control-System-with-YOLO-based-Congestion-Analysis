# Traffic-Control-System-with-YOLO-based-Congestion-Analysis
This project implements a scalable traffic control system using YOLO-based computer vision to measure congestion. It models intersections as nodes, roads as edges, and connects them to traffic lights for city-level traffic flow management. The system supports real-time traffic data aggregation, congestion monitoring, and prediction.
